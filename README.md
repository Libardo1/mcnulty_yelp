## The Story
Your parents are coming to town last minute and they want to go somewhere new. It's the first time they're meeting your new boyfriend, and they are hard to please. Your dad is picky about restaurants with long waits, ambiance is really important to your mom, and your boyfriend is concerned with the value of the food. You log on to yelp and the stress of the situation becomes too much to handle as you attempt to sift through the nobel-prize level vignettes each reviewer has left for each restaurant. How can you determine the overall experience of each restaurant when every single 5-star review scale comes with a matching essay?

## The Solution
  - What if we could clarify the overall picture of a business on yelp and __enhance the user experience__?
  
  _We can_ do this based on existing user reviews. This document will guide you through our approach to this user experience improvement for yelp users.

### The Method
Classify sentences/subtopics into 5 categories

  - initial wait
  - ambiance
  - at-table service
  - food
  - value
  
  __Sentiment analysis on each category in training set__
  
  - develop model on training data, verify its accuracy on test set

 __Model Methods__
  
  - NLP
  - classification algorithms


### Who benefits?
  - _users_ - easier __experience__ navigation
    - _Who wants to read thousands of reviews to get a sense for a place?_ The single five-star review can mean many different things to many different people. We show this through the _sentiment of existing user reviews_
  - _businesses_ - can learn with ease on a granular level what they can improve
  - _yelp_ - could lead to more actively engaged users
